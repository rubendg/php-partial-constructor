# Sch√∂nfinkelize your constructor - or partial constructor application for PHP

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/rubendg/php-partial-constructor.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/rubendg/php-partial-constructor)

A library for partially applying object constructors. It puts you in control
over *when* you provide *which* constructor arguments, instead of all or none.

A quick example. Suppose you have a class *Foo*:

      ``` php
      <?php
      class Foo {
         public function __construct(A $a, B $b) {}
      }
      ```

and you want to provide *A*, but provide *B* at a later moment. Normally this would not 
be possible, and one has to reach to other means like using a setter:

      ``` php
      <?php
      class Foo {
         public function __construct(A $a) {}

         public function setB(B $b) {}
      }
      ```

This would however imply that every method relying on the presence of *B* will
need an additional consistency check. If *B* really is an integral part of what
it means to be a *Foo* it should belong in the constructor, not in a setter.

Using the library it is possible to maintain the previous design with a little
extra help:

      ``` php
      <?php
      $foo = new Foo_;

      $fooWithA = $foo->apply(['a' => new A]);
      ```

Note that we did not create an instance of *Foo* but of *Foo_*. 
*Foo_* is actually a wrapper around the construction process of *Foo*. It
provides you with an *apply* method that takes an unordered list of 
constructor parameters and dependent on whether all arguments are provided 
instantiates the target class *Foo*. 

All you need to do is create a companion class for *Foo* called *Foo_*: 

      ``` php
      <?php
      class Foo_ extends Schoenfinkelize {
         protected static $typeMap;
         protected static $targetClassName = 'Foo';
      }
      ```

Where "$targetClassName" points to the target class.

Obviously creating these companion classes quickly becomes tiresome. You can
you can get rid of the manual boilerplate creation by hooking into the class loading
process and let it generate the appropriate classes on the fly.

If you are in a [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) project all you have to do 
is create your own "autoload.php" file adapting the one generated by Composer:

      ``` php
      <?php
      use \Schoenfinkel\Integration\CodeGenerator;
      use \Schoenfinkel\Integration\PostfixClassNameMapping;
      use \Schoenfinkel\Integration\ClassLoader\SchoenfinkelClassLoader;

      $loader = require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
      $custom = new SchoenfinkelClassLoader($loader, new CodeGenerator(new PostfixClassNameMapping()));
      $loader->unregister();
      spl_autoload_register(array($custom, 'loadClass'));
      ```

By default classes which have an underscore at the end will be treated
as classes that can have their constructor partially applied. The class
name without the underscore will become the target class name. Of course you
can change this behavior to your own liking by either setting a different
postfix on the *PostfixClassNameMapping* or implement your own *ClassNameMapping*.

Note that currently the implementation uses *eval* for bringing the generated code into scope. 
This may be a problem for you if you have disabled *eval* in the [disabled_functions](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.disable-functions) directive.

To sum up some of the advantages of using the library:

- Replaces the need for the [Builder pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) in simple cases
- No more setters and if statements for properties that should really be provided to the constructor
- You can use type hinting for classes with partial construction enabled
- Until the application of all constructor parameters every parameter can modified/overwritten
- Partially applied objects can be passed around like ordinary classes
- Independent of dependency injection framework (as opposed to [guice](http://slesinsky.org/brian/code/guice_with_curry.html))
- Nicely integrates with Composer projects
- Type hint checks are maintained during partial application
- The library also plays nice with the [Symfony DIC](http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-components-the-dependency-injection-container)
  as it allows constructor parameters to be passed immediately into the constructor:

         ``` xml
         <service id="a" class="A"/>

         <service id="foo" class="Foo_">
            <argument type="collection">
               <argument key="a" id="a" type="service"/>
            </argument>
         </service>
         ```
         
Disadvantages:

- Induces a slight performance overhead. 

        ./vendor/bin/phpunit test/performance/PerformanceTest.php

  Shows that plain object construction is about 26 times faster.
- Does not work for constructors that take a variable amount of arguments (using func_get_args())
- Default and optional arguments are treated as regular (required) arguments. 

Future:

- Maybe provide class generation based on PHP annotations @Curried
- Maybe replace *eval* with something like this: http://www.whitewashing.de/2010/12/18/generate-proxy-code-using-a-stream-wrapper.html
